    """
    This class is a default implementation of an import resolver.
    This resolver uses the rules to replace URL's prefix with another prefix
    and tries to resolve the new URL (after the prefix has been replaced).
    If there aren't any rules, none of the rules matches or
    none of the prefix replacements works,
    the resolver will try to use the original URL.

    Each rule in the ``rules`` list is expected to be
    a dictionary with one (key, value) pair which represents
    a prefix and its replacement which can be used to resolve the import url.

    The resolver will go over the rules and for each matching rule
    (its key is a prefix of the url) it will replace the prefix
    with the value and will try to resolve the new url.

    For example:
        The rules list: [
            {'http://prefix1': 'http://prefix1_replacement'},
            {'http://prefix2': 'http://prefix2_replacement1'},
            {'http://prefix2': 'http://prefix2_replacement2'}
        ]
        contains three rules that can be used for resolve URLs that
        starts with 'http://prefix1' and 'http://prefix2'.
        If the url is 'http://prefix2.suffix2.org' than the resolve method
        will find a match in both the second and the third rules.

        It will first try to apply the second rule by replacing the url's
        prefix with the second rule value ('http://prefix2_replacement1')
        and will try to resolve the new url:
        'http://prefix2_replacement1.suffix2.org'.

        In case this url cannot be resolved, it will try to apply
        the third rule by replacing the url's prefix with
        the third rule value ('http://prefix2_replacement2')
        and will try to resolve the url:
        'http://prefix2_replacement2.suffix2.org'.

        If this url, also, cannot be resolved,
        it will try to resolve the original url,
        i.e. http://prefix2.suffix2.org'

        In case that all the resolve attempts will fail,
        a DSLParsingLogicException will be raise.
